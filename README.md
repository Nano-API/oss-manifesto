# NanoAPI - Development Manifesto
At NanoAPI, we believe in the power of community software. Our mission is to provide tools that empower developers, contribute to the ecosystem in a meaningful and sustainable way, and help the community.

#### 1. Open by Default
We are committed to making as much of our code as possible open and accessible to everyone. Our philosophy is that transparency breeds trust, and by sharing our work openly, we invite the community to engage with us and help to make our vision of a new development paradigm a probable reality.

#### 2. Open-Core, Empowering Developers
We also understand the power of solvency. An amazing project that dies within its first year can never grow to help anyone. Our solution to this is via open-core: a foundation of free, free-source tools with an optional layer of enhanced functionality for enterprise-level use. This model enables us to provide a solid base for developers at all levels while allowing us to sustain our efforts with features tailored to more complex organizational needs. We will regularly revisit and revise this model.

#### 3. Collaboration Over Competition
We view other projects, even those with overlap, as opportunities for collaboration, not competition. We want to integrate with other open-source, open-core, and fair-source tools, and are making an open call for partnerships with teams behind popular web frameworks. Please contact info@nanoapi.io for collaboration suggestions.

#### 4. Empowering the Developer Community
We are passionate about giving back to the community that makes open-source possible. We aim to support developers through mentorship, our network, and resources that help them grow. As Techstars alumni, we are in a wonderful position to share our network with developers.

#### 5. Sustainability and Responsibility
Open-source isn't just about code—it's about building a sustainable and responsible ecosystem. At NanoAPI we’ve written a whitepaper on how our tooling has a positive impact on reduction of energy used by APIs. We plan to continue to grow into this space and support this and similar initiatives as we expand.

#### 6. Fostering Inclusivity and Diversity
We believe that great software comes from diverse perspectives. Our team is a multinational group of people from the Netherlands, to France, to the USA; and we love this and want to keep these values alive. Additionally, we find anti-diversity individuals to be extremely exhausting to work with, which we look to avoid.

#### 7. Supporting Ethical Use
We understand the profound impact software can have, and we are committed to ensuring our projects are used ethically. We will actively discourage the use of our software for harmful purposes, including any activities that violate human rights or perpetuate injustice.

At NanoAPI, we see open-source as more than just accessible tooling—it’s a way to connect, innovate, and give back. We invite everyone to join us on this journey as we build tools that help developers solve real-world problems and create a more open, collaborative future for software development.
